## Features

**AI Workflow**

- **Vacancy analysis** — paste any job posting and get a structured breakdown: responsibilities, must-haves, ATS keywords, and a match preview against your profile
- **Resume tailoring** — AI picks which experiences and skills are most relevant, with reasoning for every include/exclude decision
- **ATS score check** — score your tailored resume 0–100 with HIGH/MED/LOW priority fixes and keyword coverage gaps
- **Cover letter generation** — full cover letter drafted from your resume and the posting; choose tone: Professional, Confident & Direct, or Warm & Narrative
- **Bullet rephrasing** — select any bullet or paragraph, AI rewrites it for stronger impact in-place
- **Resume import** — upload a PDF or DOCX and AI extracts and structures it into your career database automatically
- **10 AI providers** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Mistral, Groq, xAI, Cohere, z.ai, Ollama (fully offline), custom endpoint. API keys stored in your local database, never in `.env`

**Career Database**

- **Driven Resume** — your permanent private career database with 11 sections: Work Experience, Education, Skills, Projects, Certifications, Awards, Volunteering, Publications, and more. Unlimited entries, never exported or shared
- **Multi-language resumes** — maintain separate resumes in different languages (English, German, French, and more) for different job markets
- **Resume import** — bootstrap your database by uploading an existing PDF or DOCX

**Applications**

- **Per-application packages** — each application gets its own tailored resume, cover letter, and tracking. Changes in one never affect another
- **Application Tracker** — sortable table and Kanban board with status (Saved → Applied → Screening → Interview → Offer), salary range, deadline, follow-up date, and excitement rating (1–5 stars)

**Export & Templates**

- **PDF export** — WYSIWYG via headless Chrome (Puppeteer); what you see is what you get
- **DOCX export** — for recruiters who require Word format
- **4 built-in templates** — ATS Simple, Professional Classic, Modern Minimal, International/German-style

**Privacy & Control**

- All data stored locally in PostgreSQL — nothing sent to any cloud service
- AI calls go directly from the app to your chosen provider — no intermediary backend
- For zero data leaving your machine, use [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) as your AI provider
- Two deployment modes: local (no login) or self-hosted with passwordless email OTP

## Self-Hosting

For multi-device access with email-based authentication:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
AUTH_MODE=email_otp
ALLOWED_EMAIL=you@example.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<run: openssl rand -base64 32>
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com

SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=you@example.com
SMTP_PASS=your-password
SMTP_FROM=Driven Resume <you@example.com>
```

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

On first visit, enter your email. A 6-digit OTP is sent to `ALLOWED_EMAIL`. No passwords are ever set or stored.

---

## Development Setup

**Requirements:** Node.js 20+, Docker

```bash
# Start database + Mailhog (email catch at http://localhost:8025)
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

cp .env.example .env
npm install
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npm run dev   # → http://localhost:3000
```

**Useful commands:**

```bash
npm run dev               # Dev server with hot reload
npm run build             # Production build
npm run lint              # ESLint
npm run type-check        # TypeScript check

npx prisma studio         # Database GUI → http://localhost:5555
npx prisma migrate dev    # Apply schema changes
npx prisma generate       # Regenerate Prisma client
```
